Exception Handling
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions.
● Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the
execution.
● On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur
which changes the normal flow of the program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between Syntax Errors and Exceptions
Syntax Error: As the name suggests this error is caused by the wrong syntax in the
code. It leads to the termination of the program.
Example:
Consider the given code snippet:
We will get the output as:
The syntax error is because there should be a “:” at the end of an if statement.
Since it is not present, it gives a syntax error.
Exceptions: Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct but the
code resulted in an error. This error does not stop the execution of the program,
however, it changes the normal flow of the program.
Example:
6
amount = 10000
if(amount>2999)
 print("Something")
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
