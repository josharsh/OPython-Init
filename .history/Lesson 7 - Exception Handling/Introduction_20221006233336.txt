Exception Handling
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions.
● Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the
execution.
● On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur
which changes the normal flow of the program.
