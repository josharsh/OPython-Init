Catching Exceptions
In Python, exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks.
● If the Python program contains suspicious code that may throw the
exception, we must place that code in the try block.
● The try block must be followed by the except statement, which contains a
block of code that will be executed in case there is some exception in the try
block.
● We can thus choose what operations to perform once we have caught the
exception.
● Here is a simple example:

# import module sys to get the type of exception
import sys
l = ['a', 0, 2]
for ele in l:
    try:#This block might raise an exception while executing
    print("The entry is", ele)
    r = 1/int(ele)
    break
    except:#This block executes in case of an exception in "try"
    print("Oops!", sys.exc_info()[0], "occurred.")
    print()
print("The reciprocal of", ele, "is", r)

We get the output to this code as:

    The entry is a
    Oops! <class 'ValueError'> occurred.
    The entry is 0
    Oops! <class 'ZeroDivisionError'> occured.
    The entry is 2
    The reciprocal of 2 is 0.5

● In this program, we loop through the values of a list l.
● As previously mentioned, the portion that can cause an exception is placed
inside the try block.
● If no exception occurs, the except block is skipped and normal flow
continues(for last value).
● But if any exception occurs, it is caught by the except block (first and second
values).
● Here, we print the name of the exception using the exc_info() function
inside sys module.
● We can see that element “a” causes ValueError and 0 causes
ZeroDivisionError.
Every exception in Python inherits from the base Exception class. Thus we can
write the above code as:

l = ['a', 0, 2]
for ele in l:
    try:
    print("The entry is", ele)
    r = 1/int(ele)
    except Exception as e: #Using Exception class
    print("Oops!", e.__class__, "occurred.")
    print("Next entry.")
    print()
print("The reciprocal of", ele, "is", r)

Catching Specific Exceptions in Python
● In the above example, we did not mention any specific exception in the
except clause.
● This is not a good programming practice as it will catch all exceptions and
handle every case in the same way.
● We can specify which exceptions an except clause should catch.
● A try clause can have any number of except clauses to handle different
exceptions, however, only one will be executed in case an exception occurs.
● You can use multiple except blocks for different types of exceptions.
● We can even use a tuple of values to specify multiple exceptions in an except
clause. Here is an example to understand this better:
try:
    a=10/0;
except(ArithmeticError, IOError):
    print("Arithmetic Exception")
else:
    print("Successfully Done")

Output:
Arithmetic Exception
