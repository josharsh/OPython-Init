# OOP Implementation Using Python


## TASK 1: Refer the Internet for turtle module of Python. Study about Class implementation from given repository resources and write a python script for making an animation of multiple squares deviating at an angle to form a circle.


## Assistance: 



*   Python Standard Library has a module called 'turtle'
*   turtle module has a class called Turtle
*   Calling turtle.Turtle() instantiates the class.
*   Refer to the Internet for turtle documentation
*   Check on Resources to get the solution 


## TASK 2: Using Twilio module of python (which is not a part of Standard Python Library) write a python script that can send a message to a phone number. Study about Twilio and python usage from the Internet.

(Messages from a small piece of code?? Interesting!)


## Assistance: 



*   Study about module called Twilio
*   Twilio account in needed to use the API
*   Be careful about Auth Token
*   Refer to the Internet for complete documentation of Twilio module
*   Check on Resources to get the solution
