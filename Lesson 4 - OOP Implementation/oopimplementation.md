# OOP Implementation Using Python

## TASK 1: Refer to the Internet for the turtle module of Python. Study about Class implementations from given repository resources and write a python script to make an animation of multiple squares deviating at an angle to form a circle.

## Assistance:

- Python Standard Library has a module called 'turtle'
- The turtle module has a class called Turtle
- Calling turtle.Turtle() instantiates the class.
- Refer to the Internet for the turtle documentation
- Check on Resources to get the solution

## TASK 2: Using Twilio module of python (which is not a part of Standard Python Library) write a python script that can send a message to a phone number. Study about Twilio and python usage from the Internet.

(Messages from a small piece of code?? Interesting!)

## Assistance:

- Study the module called Twilio
- A Twilio account is needed to use the API
- Be careful of the Auth Token
- Refer to the Internet for complete documentation of Twilio module
- Check on Resources to get the solution
