    "Variables are anything that store some value in them and are subject to be changed. In Python, we don’t declare the datatype of variables while initializing them; we simply write their name and assign them values. There is no semicolon to be used to end lines unlike in C or C++.\n",
    "Jupyter always prints the variables after we initialize them, so there usually is no need to write print(variable) separately. But only the variable declared last is printed and not the ones before it, so the print() function is to be used for printing out all variables. \n",

    "3.\tLists are the Python equivalent of arrays, and are the most versatile of Python's data types.\n",

    "5.\tPython's dictionaries are kind of hash table type, and consist of key-value pairs.\n",
    "It is to be kept in mind that the order of cells is not important; the order of execution is important. So you can run the second cell before the first (if they’re not connected, that is) – and it would not be a problem. Connected means that there is some dependency between the two cells – for instance, the first cell has declared some variables that are being used in the second cell. In that case, the first cell has to be executed first and only then the second can be called.\n",
    "You can perform operations on Python variables just as in all other languages. However, in the case of division: dividing two integers will return a float value which won’t be floored to an int (unlike in C++).
