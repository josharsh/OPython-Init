# Python: An Introduction

Python is a popular open source programming language designed by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is a general-purpose, high-level programming language maintained by the Python Software Foundation.

Before you head forward, it is important to note that there are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. The two versions have significant differences (more on this later).
