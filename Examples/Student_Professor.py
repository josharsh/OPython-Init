'''
A sample code to show Object Oriented Programming in Python. 
Two class definitions are given : Student Class & Professor Class
Student Class has attributes - Roll Number , Name , Group (Red/Blue)
Professor Class has attributes - Name , Subject , List Of Student Objects
Three objects of student class are instantiated in main() and are assigned to a professor which is also instantiated in main().
Another student object is instantiated and it's equality is tested, followed by modification of it's data attributes through Setters.
Print Details Function of both the classes are called in main()
