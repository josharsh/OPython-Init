# Object-Oriented Basics Using Python

(Source: [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm))

Python has been an object-oriented language since it existed. Because of this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult an introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic concepts.However, here is a small introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to bring you at speed −


## Overview of OOP Terminology



*   Class − A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize an object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.
*   Class variable − A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.
*   Data member − A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.
*   Function overloading − The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.
*   Instance variable − A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.
*   Inheritance − The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.
*   Instance − An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.
*   Instantiation − The creation of an instance of a class.
*   Method − A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.
*   Object − A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.
*   Operator overloading − The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.

EXAMPLE:


```
class Student:
   'Common base class for all Students'
   stuCount = 0

   def __init__(self, name, marks):
      self.name = name
      self.marks = marks
      Student.stuCount += 1

   def displayCount(self):
     print "Total Student %d" % Student.stuCount

   def displayStudent(self):
      print "Name : ", self.name,  ", marks: ", self.marks
```



## **Python Objects (Instances)**

(Source: [https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/))

While the class is the blueprint, an _instance_ is a copy of the class with _actual_ values, literally an object belonging to a specific class. It's not an idea anymore; it's an actual animal, like a dog named Roger who's eight years old.

Put another way, a class is like a form or questionnaire. It defines the needed information. After you fill out the form, your specific copy is an instance of the class; it contains actual information relevant to you.

You can fill out multiple copies to create many different instances, but without the form as a guide, you would be lost, not knowing what information is required. Thus, before you can create individual instances of an object, we must first specify what is needed by defining a class.

### CREATING CLASS AND OBJECT IN PYTHON

```
class Parrot:

    # class attribute
    species = "bird"

    # instance attribute
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```
# instantiate the Parrot class
~~~
blu = Parrot("Blu", 10)
woo = Parrot("Woo", 15)
~~~
# access the class attributes
~~~
print("Blu is a {}".format(blu.__class__.species))
print("Woo is also a {}".format(woo.__class__.species))
~~~
# access the instance attributes
~~~
print("{} is {} years old".format( blu.name, blu.age))
print("{} is {} years old".format( woo.name, woo.age))
~~~

## **Python Inheritance **

(Source: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oop-in-python-set-3-inheritance-examples-of-object-issubclass-and-super/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oop-in-python-set-3-inheritance-examples-of-object-issubclass-and-super/)

Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.
